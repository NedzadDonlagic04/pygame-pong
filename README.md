# pygame-pong

In this project I will be making the classic pong
game in pygame.<br />
The left side uses W and S to move up and down.<br />
The right side uses the up arrow key and down 
arrow key to move up and down.<br />
If you let 3 balls cross over to the border of
the screen on your side you lose.<br />
Have fun!
